## Ingredients
- 2 cups (240g) Divided Sunset Gluten Free All Purpose Flour
- 1 cup (241g) Lactose Free Milk
- 6 tbsp Olive Oil Butter (cold)
- 1 tbsp Baking powder
- 1 tbsp white sugar, granulated 
- 1/2 tbsp Baking soda
- 1/2 tsp Salt


## Instructions
1. For best results, chill butter in freezer for 10-20 minutes before beginning the recipe. The butter needs to be cold for a lighter biscuit.
2. Preheat oven to 425° (218° C)
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, baking soda, baking soda, sugar, salt and set to the side.
4. Remove the butter from the freezer and cut into very small cubes, or you can use a box grater to shred the butter into small pieces.
5. Add the butter to the flour and mix until it resembles coarse crumbs. You can use a pastry cutter or fork to do this.
6. After it is mixed, add the milk and use a wooden spoon until combined. (Don’t overwork the dough, just until you see small pieces of butter throughout the dough)
7. Transfer the dough to a large piece of parchment paper on the counter. Use your hand to work dough together.
8. Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and flatten the layers.
9. Rotate the dough and fold in half over itself and flatten the layers.

	Repeat 3-4 times. The dough may feel slightly wet.

10. Once complete, flatten out the dough ball into a 1-in (2.54cm) slab of dough. You can do this by hand unless a rolling pin is easier.
11. Cut the dough into as many separate 2.5in (6.35cm) circles as you can. Transfer those dough circles onto a baking sheet.

	You can use a glass, a measuring cup - whatever size matches how round you want the biscuits to be.

12. Place baking sheet into the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
13. Serve warm - any remaining biscuits can be stored in an airtight container for 2-3 days.
