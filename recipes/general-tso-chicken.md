## Ingredients
- 2 lb chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup corn starch
- 1/4 cup extra light olive oil, for frying (plus more as needed)
- 2 tbsp minced ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)
- 1 tsp sesame seeds (optional garnish)
	These ingredients are for the sauce:
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 5 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
- 3 tbsp rice vinegar (or more to taste)
- 1 1/2 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 4 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch

## Instructions
1. Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Toss chicken in batches with corn starch, tapping off the excess. Set dredged chicken on a platter and set aside.
2. In a separate dish, combine all sauce ingredients and whisk to combine.
3. Preheat a non-stick skillet with oil. Cook chicken in 2–3 batches, sautéing until golden on all sides and cooked through, then remove to a bowl.
4. Leave about 1 tbsp of oil in the pan. Add garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes; sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
5. Pour the sauce into the skillet and bring to a simmer, stirring. Let simmer for about 1 minute.
6. Add the cooked chicken back into the sauce and toss to coat evenly.
7. Serve hot, garnished with sesame seeds if desired.
